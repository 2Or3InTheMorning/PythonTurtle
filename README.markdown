PythonTurtle aims to be the most low-threshold way for learning or teaching Python. The user is given command of an interactive Python shell, similar to IDLE, and is able to use Python functions to move a turtle that is displayed on the screen. An illustrated help screen demonstrates how to move the turtle and introduces the student to the basics of Python programming.
